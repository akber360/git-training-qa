# q1 Create a python file that will input your first name, last name and outputs "Hello [firstname] [lastname]"

#f_name = input("What is your first name? ")
#l_name = input("What is yout last name? ")
#print ("Hello",f_name,l_name)

#q2 Open a new window and type the following:
number1 = float(input("Please enter the first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Please enter the second number: "))
answer = number1 + number2
print(number1, "+", number2, "=", answer)
# This code takes two inputs from the user which can be decimal places due to using float, it adds
# up the two inputs and gives them total as answer.
