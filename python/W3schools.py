#1. Write a Python program to find those numbers
    #which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
#result = []
#for num in range(1500,2701):
#    if num %7==0 and num % 5 ==0:
#        result.append(num)
#    print (num)

#2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
#Expected Output :
#60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
#45°F is 7 in Celsius
temp_in = input("please enter the temperature in C or F ")
temp = temp_in.upper()

if "C" in temp:



    print (temp)
if "F" in temp
